# All Issues Fixed - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… Checkout Page Shows Static Total ($784)
**Problem:** Checkout page was using hardcoded cart items instead of real cart data.

**Fixed:**
- Integrated `useCart()` hook in checkout page
- Now uses dynamic `cartItems`, `subtotal`, `tax`, `shipping`, and `total` from CartContext
- Removed hardcoded mock cart items
- Added cart empty check - redirects to products if cart is empty
- Clears cart after successful order placement

**Files Modified:**
- `app/checkout/page.tsx`

### 2. âœ… Landing Page Personalization for Logged-In Users
**Problem:** Landing page looked the same for all users, not well aligned.

**Fixed:**

**Hero Section:**
- Personalized heading: "Welcome Back! Discover More Amazing Products"
- Different description for logged-in users
- Changed "Shop Now" â†’ "Continue Shopping"
- Changed "Learn More" â†’ "My Orders" button
- Better responsive text sizing
- Enhanced dark mode support

**Featured Products:**
- Title changes: "Featured Products" â†’ "Recommended for You, [Name]"
- Personalized description: "Products picked just for you"
- Better responsive layout (flex-col on mobile, flex-row on desktop)
- "View All" â†’ "View All Products"
- Dark mode support added

**Categories:**
- Added full dark mode support
- Better hover states for dark mode
- Fixed apostrophe in "you're"

**Files Modified:**
- `components/home/Hero.tsx` (now client component)
- `components/home/FeaturedProducts.tsx` (now client component)
- `components/home/Categories.tsx`

### 3. âœ… Add to Cart on Landing Page
**Problem:** Featured products missing category property.

**Fixed:**
- Added `category` property to all featured products:
  - Premium Wireless Headphones â†’ 'Audio'
  - Smart Watch Series 5 â†’ 'Wearables'
  - Wireless Earbuds Pro â†’ 'Audio'
  - Bluetooth Speaker â†’ 'Audio'
- Now works same as product pages

**Files Modified:**
- `components/home/FeaturedProducts.tsx`

### 4. ðŸš§ Cart Items to Database (Not Implemented Yet)
**Status:** Currently using localStorage for cart persistence.

**To Implement:**
1. Create cart table in Prisma schema
2. Create API routes for cart operations
3. Sync localStorage with database on user actions
4. Load cart from database on sign-in

**Why Not Done Now:**
- Current localStorage solution works well
- Database integration requires schema changes
- Would need backend API routes
- Consider doing this after testing current fixes

## What Changed

### Checkout Page - Before vs After

**Before:**
```typescript
// Hardcoded items
const cartItems = [
  { id: '1', name: 'Premium Wireless Headphones', price: 299.99, quantity: 1 },
  { id: '2', name: 'Smart Watch Series 5', price: 399.99, quantity: 1 },
];
const subtotal = 699.98; // Static
const total = 784.97;     // Static - always shows $784!
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Dynamic from CartContext
const { cartItems, subtotal, tax, shipping, total, clearCart } = useCart();
// All values update automatically based on real cart!
```

### Landing Page - Before vs After

**Before:**
- Generic "Discover Amazing Products"
- "Shop Now" button
- "Learn More" button
- Same for everyone

**After (Logged In):**
- "Welcome Back! Discover More Amazing Products"
- "Continue Shopping" button
- "My Orders" button
- "Recommended for You, [Name]" section
- Personalized descriptions

**After (Logged Out):**
- Same as before (unchanged for logged-out users)
